        The App Engine datastore uses indexes for every query your application makes.
        These indexes are updated whenever an entity changes,
        so the results can be returned quickly when the app makes a query.
        To do this, the datastore needs to know in advance which queries the application will make.
        You specify which indexes your app needs in a configuration file.
