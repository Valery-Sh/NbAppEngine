        The App Engine Cron Service allows you to configure regularly scheduled
        tasks that operate at defined times or regular intervals.
        These tasks are commonly known as cron jobs.
        These cron jobs are automatically triggered by the App Engine Cron Service.
        For instance, you might use this to send out a report email on a daily basis,
        to update some cached data every 10 minutes, or to update some summary information once an hour.
