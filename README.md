Version 2.0.0
-------------

This version (nbappengine-7.3.x-gae1.8.x-2.0.0.zip) does not depend on the Netbeans modules that provide access to "friends" only. Thus, it can be used for all minor versions of the NetBeans IDE ( 7.3 and 7.3.1 for example).

The plugin supports version 2.x of the DataNucleus plugin for App Engine, which corresponds 
to DataNucleus Access Platform 3.0 and JPA 2.0.

Early versions are:   nbappengine-7.3-gae1.8.x-1.3.0.zip and nbappengine-7.3.1-gae1.8.x-1.3.2.zip_.

Choose .zip file from the list and download it.

The build is compiled with jdk7 but the source code doesn't contain specific for java 7 code. So it can be 
compiled with jdk6.

Improvements
------------

Allows correctly Run/Debug/Deploy/Profile any open project.
