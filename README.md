NetBeans IDE plugin for Google App Engine (NbAppEngine)
=======================================================

The clone from https://kenai.com/projects/nbappengine/pages/Home

Where to Download
-----------------

Released builds (zipped nbms) can be found here:


https://code.google.com/p/nb-gaelyk-plugin/downloads/list

Choose the file  _nbappengine-7.3-gae1.8.x.zip or nbappengine-7.3.1-gae1.8.x.zip_  from the list and download it.
The build is compiled with jdk7 but the source code doesn't contain specific for java 7 code. So it can be 
compiled with jdk6.

Improvements
------------

Allows correctly Run/Debug/Deploy/Profile any open project.
